# Bomberman-Game
Implementing a classic game with a minimalistic design made completely in the assembly language of the x86 Intel family.

The game can be played by running "bomberman.exe".

Short tutorial:

1. The Bomberman is represented by the red square ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) and can be moved using the black arrows on the bottom left.
2. A bomb can be placed by clicking the "BOMB" button close to the arrows. The bomb will be represented by an orange/black square ![#FFBD00](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFBD00/000000?text=+)/![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+)
and it will explode after a short animation (beware not to find yourself close to the bomb, otherwise you'll lose)
3. An enemy is represented by the pink square ![#FF00E4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF00E4/000000?text=+). It will move on the map and can be killed using a bomb.
If the enemy runs into you, it's game over.
4. Boxes are represented by brown squares ![#824300](https://via.placeholder.com/15/824300/000000?text=+). They block the path but can be destoryed with bombs.
5. All the grey squares ![#909090](https://via.placeholder.com/15/909090/000000?text=+) are walls. They block the path and can't be destroyed.
